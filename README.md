# Indian-eCommerce-Seller-Fees-Calculator
This is a C++ project that basically calculates the fees that is deducted from seller's remittance. 
The rates are taken from near-to-real-world deductions done by Indian eCommerce websites like Flipkart, Snapdeal, eBay etc.
PS -  I've not cleaned up the code, so basically everything is in just one .cpp file(which I know is not a good practice :) )
Also this project considers the user to be a Seller.
###About this project
Every record is marked by a Unique ID.
The program is in a menu driven form having four options - create a new record, show an existing record knowing an existing ID, delete a record and also showing all record IDs.
On creation of a new record, it saves those particular details on the system for future usage/implementation.


The program requires the user to input details like Category of product, which website was it sold on, and other details like dimensions of the package.
After this, the fees is calculated on the basis of many variables like Transaction Fee, Final Value Fee and many more.



You may run this code in CodeBlocks(As I'm not sure about other IDEs).
The project was submitted as a 12th Standard Computer Science Project and was last updated in March 2016.
